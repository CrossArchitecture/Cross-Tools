This repository serves to document all "Cross-Tools", how they work, what is the idea behind them and how they were implemented! The project was developed during an internship at Cross Architecture Aachen as part of the Master in Construction and Robotics at RWTH Aachen University. The aim was to implement a set of tools that the entire Cross Architecture team could use to simplify and in many cases automate repetitive, tedious and complicated tasks in their daily work with Revit. These quality of life tools were constantly tested and adapted to the working conditions. </p>

## General Information
Cross-Tools is a collection of tools based on Dynamo and/or Python. The aim of these tools is to make your daily work with Revit easier. During the course of a building project, our architects are faced with a number of tasks that need to be completed. These tasks can often be repetitive and time consuming. That's why Cross Tools are designed to help with automation and management tasks. This includes facilitating the creation of plan sheets as well as alert management in the model. Under [Features](#Features) all tools are listed and described in their use case.


## Requirements
In order for Cross-Tools to run on your computer, you will need to do a few installations beforehand. Cross-Tools is based on pyRevit and this is where we start.
1. Install the latest [pyRevit version](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases), during the development of Cross-Tools the version [v4.8.12.22247](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases/tag/v4.8.12.22247%2B0031) was used. The installation is self-explanatory and very well documented, but a look at the [Notion Page](https://pyrevitlabs.notion.site/pyrevitlabs/pyRevit-bd907d6292ed4ce997c46e84b6ef67a0) is worthwhile.
